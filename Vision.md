# Goal of the program:

The goal of the program is to create a rainmeter skin, with supporting backend, that does the following things:
1. It has a calendar where I can assign a set of tasks.
2. It has an option of exporting the calendar to an ics format. 
3. There is an event reminder for the upcoming tasks.
4. Editing can be done from the Calendar skin itself.

## Calendar Features:
1. Color coding for the tasks.
2. Clicking on an empty slot creates a new task, while clicking on an upcoming task edits it. Past tasks cannot be updated.
3. Recurring options for tasks, like in teams.
4. Syncing with Google Calendar.

## MVP Features:
- Offline calendar on Rainmeter.
    - Need to learn Lua Scripting for this? 
    - Maybe I can make a prototype in Python.
- Ability to edit tasks on the go.
